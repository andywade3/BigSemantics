BigSemantics
============

'''BigSemantics''' is a free and open-source software architecture for developing powerful applications that present interactive semantic information (<i>metadata</i>) from diverse information sources. Semantic information provides a summary of the underlying information resource that can be seen by the user without leaving the current context or site.

An example is the [http://ecologylab.net/mice Metadata In-Context Expander (MICE)] which helps the user maintain context while exploring linked semantic information. The MICE homepage shows semantic information for a CD on Amazon. Linked information, such as related bestseller lists or items people also buy, can be expanded in the same context. Some more examples:
